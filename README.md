# Shopping-Trends-Analysis
The objective of the Customer Shopping Trends Dataset is to analyze the purchasing patterns of customers. By exploring this dataset, I can gain insights into what customers are buying the most. This analysis can help identify popular products, understand consumer preferences, and potentially inform marketing or inventory strategies. By examining the dataset's variables and conducting exploratory data analysis, I can uncover trends, patterns, and correlations that contribute to a better understanding of customer shopping behavior.
